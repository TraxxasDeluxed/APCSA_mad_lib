# AP CSA Madlibs 1.2.10

## This code is meant to be able to get a user's responses to questions and use that to replace prompts in a madlib.

### Time Chart 
| Milestone | Estimated development time | Actual development time |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Create the madlib riddles | 5 mins | 2 mins |
| Find each part of speech | 20 mins | 35 mins |
| Show each part of speech to the user | 15 mins | 15 mins |
| Get the userâ€™s response | 5 min | 5 min |
| Create and show the solved Mad Lib | 5 mins | 5 mins |

The estimated time compared to the actual time is generally closer to the actual time.

### Challenges 
 - ~~Being able to fetch the location of the angled brackets, especially the end angle brackets, where we had to +1 to get the length of the entire word as the index is one less compared to the length of a string~~
 - ~~Being able to display the madlib~~

### Goals
 - ~~Solve madlibs with any amount of prompts~~
 - ~~Be able to find the prompts using angle brackets~~
 - ~~Display result to the user~~
